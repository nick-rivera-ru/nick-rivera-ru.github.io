How do you define your best customers? 

The ones who make the largest purchases? 
The ones who purchase the most frequently? 
The ones who’ve been with you the longest? 

While any of these questions might prompt a list of customers we might deem our “best”, reality is never really that simple. 

Let’s illustrate with an example. 

Customer A’s average order size is $500. 
Customer B’s average order size is $150. 


The value of a customer can be defined through a simple equation:

 (Avg order value) * (Visits per Year) * (Expected Years as Customer)

Average Order Value is important because it’s a direct result of the economic partnership between ourselves and our customers. 
Visits per Year is important because it accounts for the frequency with which we do business with our customers
Expected Years as a Customer is important because it allows us to quantify the expected future value of our customers 

With our formula set, let’s illustrate with an example. For simplicities sake, we will assume that both customers will visit 4 times a year and we will assume that both customers will be customers for 5 years. 

The value of our customers is:

Customer A = $500 * 4 * 5
Customer A = $10,000

Customer B = $150 * 4 * 5
Customer B = $3,000

Holding static 2 of the 3 inputs of the customer value equation makes it clear, customers with higher average order values are more valuable than customers with lower average order values. 
This method is easy to keep our most important customers top of mind. Although, as we discussed earlier, reality is never this simple. 

If we matrix out customer B’s potential value, it shows a slightly different picture. 



With only 10 more visits in a year, Customer B’s value surpasses Customer A’s value. 

While average order value is an important piece of the equation, it’s not the only piece of the equation; therefore, in the evaluation of our customers, it’s important to account for order size as well as frequency. Any actionable analysis that doesn’t include both is missing half of the story. 

What about years as a customer? Years as a customer is another excellent in metric, as it’s a great proxy for a customer’s loyalty. Although, it’s a not exactly a metric that a 
customer can directly affect or improve on. For that reason, we’ll hold variable static in our equation and we can dive into it more in a later article. 

When defining your best customers, be sure to capture data to fulfill both metrics – average order value & visit frequency. These two in combination will help paint a full picture, and that only leads to better inputs in your planning cycles, be it budgeting, customer relationship management, or marketing.
